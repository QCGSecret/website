You must collect the 11 Neptunia frames, which are hidden at the following locations:

Once you have gathered all the frames, take them to the main doors. 
This will trigger a clock signal, causing an orb to appear and enter the weapon's locked container in the center.

</Header>

<GuideAlert type="warning" title="Warning">		
	Unlike the later parts of the secret, this step can be completed simultaneously with the Neptunia task!
</GuideAlert>

You need to retrieve a hidden cross from the television room, located on top of the locked containers, and place it in the puddle without a cross in the noose room.

After doing so, the three bystanders need to interact with the rope. Each sacrifice will emit a sound and burn the cross.
Upon completion, a sound cue will play, and the locked containers will unlock, revealing an ammo box inside.

<Header title="Gong" id="gong">
	4 Sherrifs
</Header>

Upon completion of each previous step, you will need to get 4 sheriffs ready for each gong.

<Dropdown title="Attic" client:only="react">

They need to shoot their gong simultaneously. One person should initiate a countdown to synchronize everyone. 
If all gongs are fired at the same time, they will resonate with a powerful sound, shattering the glass containers at the entrance. 
Failure to synchronize means they must try again.

<Header title="Doors" id="doors">
	1 player
</Header>

A player needs to interact with the now accessible Gun by using the action key.
Once done, go to the TV room to combine it with the ammo box found inside the previously locked container.
Quickly proceed to the main gate and throw the weapon at it. The door will shatter, and a metal door will close over a strange portal, preventing your exit.

<Header title="Orbs" id="orbs">
	4 players
</Header>

By shooting the bell in the center with a gun, orbs will start to appear. It's crucial to gather them swiftly. 

<GuideAlert type="info" title="Tips">
	These orbs spawn in the same sequence every game, so positioning a player near their spawn points is advantageous!
</GuideAlert>

The first orb spawns in front of the door, followed by one in the middle. 
- The third one spawns in front of the TV in the closet room. 
- The fourth spawns on the beams in the attic, requiring a bit of parkour. 
- The fifth is located between the two doors leading to the Maho bedroom. 
- The sixth is in the tunnel beneath the piano room. 
- The seventh is directly in front of the light switch, and the last one is on a barrel in the basement.

<Header title="Lights" id="lights">
	5-11 players
</Header>

You'll need to turn off the lights first. Afterward, each player must approach a light and use the action key to rotate it. 
Once all the lamps are turned, the code sequence will be verified. 
A sparking lamp indicates it's correctly placed; otherwise, adjustments are necessary. This process involves trial and error.

<Header title="Free their souls" id="souls">
	3 players
</Header>

Head to the basement and attic pressure plates and await the opening of the central gate.
Once it's open, throw all the 11 Neptunia paintings into the portal.
