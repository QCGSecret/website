Two red buttons are found under the Security Office desk. Both members of this team will have to be prepared to push the
buttons at the same time, when the sheriff calls it. In case of success, the murderer must stab the poster in the
security room, otherwise he must remain motionless and try again.

Once you have found it, you will need to shoot it for the step to begin. A spark will exit the power box and start to
move. You will need to count how many time it disappear, when the Fourth-Fifth Sparks blow you will need to call your
teammate to push the buttons to briefly disable the blockers.

<Image src="/assets/guide/casino/blockers/2buttons.png" width="721" height="721" alt="The 2 buttons." loading="lazy" />

If you hear a buzzing sound that means your teammates have succeeded. When the spark is at the last emplacement from the
breaker and disappear (7 Sparks), you must shoot the breaker to make the sparks continue to follow the cable. Repeat this
process once more, but be aware there are not as many sparks before reaching the next circuit breaker. If succeed, quickly
go down near the fate machine because there are two more breakers. After these two blockers, the spark will start it's last
thrust and move towards another electrical box. You will do the same as the blocker but the timing is not the same, so be
aware of that before shooting the box!

<br />A completion cue will play, but it's not the end, because you will need to go as quickly as possible in the
security office to shoot the blue part of the keypad, to get a key card that can be used in the keycard reader at the
main door.

Then put the credit card in the atm.

<Image src="/assets/guide/casino/bankrupt/atm.png" width="721" height="721" alt="The atm." loading="lazy" />

To obtain the code, you'll need four cards. One card is located directly on the map, and the other three are obtained by completing the roulette, candle game, and hacking game. (Please see the details in the previous tab.) 

While the card is visible on the map, you must take a specific action to reveal its number. In order to see the number on the joker card, it must be inserted into the vent twice.

To get the order of which you need to put the code in the atm you need to refer to the blackjack table.

Two blackjack tables are located near the roulette. Each table has a set of two cards, making a total of four. However, their suits and symbols change with each game :

TEN, JACK, QUEEN, and KING. While these cards are always the same, their suits and symbols change with each game. 

To obtain the ATM code, memorize the numbers and their corresponding suits from TEN to KING. Then, match these four cards with the ones you've previously acquired to get your ATM code.

<Dropdown title="Example" client:only="react">
	You have the following cards: 7 of hearts; 2 of spades; 4 of clubs; 3 of diamonds.

And the blackjack table is: 10 of diamonds; Jack of clubs; Queen of hearts and King of spades.

in the following order: 10 -> Jack -> Queen -> King

The code will be: 3472

</Dropdown>

<Header title="Chosen" id="chosen">
	1 players
</Header>

After assembling the ATM code, you can insert the credit card. You will then be prompted to enter a PIN code, but be careful—you only have three attempts. 

Once the correct PIN is entered, wait a few seconds for the money to be dispensed. Afterward, collect the money and place it in the coin exchanger to receive two yellow coins and one green coin.

One person must collect the green coin and use it on a gambling machine. After a short animation showing a win, the player will receive a lucky message. Following this, interact with the fates machine; unlike before, rather than perishing, you will receive an electric shock and be granted the Chosen Title. Go outside and approach the arcade machine to shock and activate it.

<Header title="Arcade" id="arcade">
	8 players
</Header>

After activating the machine, you'll need to insert 8 coins. Following that, you'll be prompted to donate blood; 8 people must interact with the blade on the machine and press the green button to initiate the game. Be cautious, as interacting with the blade will set your HP to 1.

This steps gives a **_120_** seconds time bonus when completed.
